                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Video games can play an important role in the development of students as extra-curricular activities in school. 
                    Not only do they provide a fun and engaging form of entertainment, but they can also help to improve various 
                    skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. Additionally, many modern video games are 
                    designed to challenge players and require a high level of strategic thinking, which can help to develop critical 
                    thinking skills that can be applied to other areas of life. Furthermore, playing video games in a school setting
                    can promote socialization and teamwork among students, as they often require communication and collaboration to
                    achieve goals. This not only helps to foster positive relationships between students, but also provides 
                    opportunities for students to develop important life skills that will be valuable to them in their future 
                    careers and personal lives.

                <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to promote the integration of esports into schools as a recognized and valuable extracurricular activity. 
                    We believe that esports provides students with unique opportunities for teamwork, strategic thinking, and problem solving, 
                    and should be treated with the same level of respect as traditional sports. By advocating for esports in schools, we hope to 
                    create a supportive environment that encourages students to pursue their interests, develop critical skills, and build 
                    meaningful relationships with their peers.
