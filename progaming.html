                    Pro gaming or e-sports can be a really fun way for all kinds of different people 
                    and although it’s not the first thing that comes to mind when you think about 
                    extracurricular activities, that doesn’t mean it’s a bad choice. Pro-gaming 
                    encourages you to discuss with all kinds of people what they think the best way
                    to achieve a goal is, whether it be beating the enemy team in a Players Vs Player game 
                    or getting the fastest lap in a racing game. Pro gaming can help you meet 
                    new people that have a shared interest with and can possibly become good friends with.
